title: Digging a Little Deeper with R
---
The interactive tools that GeoTuple provide by default (e.g. Linear Correlation), while useful for exploratory analysis, may not be powerful enough to sufficiently reveal and explain the geographic relationships of interest. Luckily, we have all the power of R at our disposal!

As outlined in [this post](https://gist.github.com/rhansson/1efb9a1b9bec053aa19d71c67f0e27a3), it is straightforward to access the data directly from R. One example: [Modeling Real Estate Value in Los Angeles](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/modeling-real-estate-value-los-angeles-neighborhood-level-hansson) - is using machine learning techniques to model and predict residential housing prices based on existing and additional data variables collected for Los Angeles County. Iâ€™m considering adding such tools to GeoTuple as well. Looking for collaboration and use cases!
