```
To inspire and enable a more sustainable and equitable world thru geographic knowledge
```

**GeoTuple** is an open cloud based platform for geospatial analysis with R. It provides a [web app](pages/app.html) and an [API service](pages/api.html), supported by a [database](pages/database.html) of geographic phenomena (themes).
It lets you visualize database themes as layers on a map and perform exploratory data analysis. For example: you can view the population density of a particular area and compute the correlation with other themes such as income per capita.
