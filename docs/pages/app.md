[GeoTuple.com](http://geotuple.com){:target="_blank"} is a dynamic web app built on the [OpenCPU framework](https://www.opencpu.org){:target="_blank"}. It consists of a JavaScript browser client and a R-Server component, designed to be an easy to use tool for exploratory geospatial analysis and geoanalytics. 
Data is provided at multiple resolutions (map scales) allowing for a near-seamless experience from global to city-block level studies (where available).

```
It is the goal of this project to add and improve the capabilities over time.
