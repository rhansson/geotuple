The database, behind GeoTuple, stores quantitative geospatial information as points (gridded), thematically organized in a PostGIS (PostgreSQL) database. The data is derived from publicly available sources into a uniform spatial resolution ranging from 250 meters for populated areas to 2 km for remote areas such as desert and mountain areas. 
The data is progressively aggregated to effectively suit larger areas (lower resolutions), without the typical restrictions of fixed boundaries such as census units. 

_Currently, data is available for the state of California, USA._

```
It is the goal of this project to expand both the area and the number of themes over time.
